# Text-Classification
Implementing Naive Bayes for Text Classification

Work being done here is:
1. Performing test classification using multinomial naive bayes with an already built-in Sklearn Model
2. Developing my own Naive Bayes classifier from the scratch.
3. Comparing the output of my Naive Bayes classifier with that of Sklearn.
